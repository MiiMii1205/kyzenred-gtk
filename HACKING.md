 # Kyzenred Hacking

So you want to extend the theme, yes? First up, let's talk about what you'll need!

First, you need to know that Kyzenred is a pure SVG theme. This means that if you want to change things you'll need to know how SVGs works, along with good HTML and CSS knowledge.

Thankfully, there's [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp). With their little SVG reference you'll be ready in no time to edit the theme!

## Generating

Unlike KDE, Kyzenred uses explicit bash scripts to recolor a SVG file. To regenerate the SVG, just run the `kyzenred-generate.sh` script in the `scripts` directory like so:
```bash
$ ./kyzenred-generate.sh
```
This will:
1. Generate a new SVG file
2. Generate a new `gtk-2.0/gtkrc` file

## Recoloring
Kyzenred is dynamically colored theme. This means that its components are dynamically recolored based on the current color scheme.

Most SVGs (excepts for GTK3) uses a system similar to KDE's plasma theme recoloring. In essence, at render time a special CSS stylesheet is inserted into the SVG file.

This stylesheet contains special CSS classes with color scheme specific colors. 

Each of these classes can be used on an SVG element to give them unique colors.

If you want to know more about it, I suggest you take a look at [KDE's plasma theming guide](https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Plasma5/ThemeDetails). There's also in this repository the `src/recolor.css` file that contains the stylesheet template to be inserted.

The theme uses a simple `sed` to replace the placeholder stylesheet with the current color scheme's color.

## Re-rendering
To fully support GTK2, the `kyzenred-generate.sh` script also render some PNG files to be used by GTK2 while rendering components.

These assets will be generated in the `assets/gtk2` directory. The `assets/gtk2` is further separated into many sub-directories, each containing diff√©rents GTK2 assets.

To know where each `.png` files goes, a special file (`scripts/gtk2-assets.txt`) is used. These contains a list of `.png` file names. Should you need to add a new `.png` file this is where it happens.

Once it's rendering time, the system will look into this file and render the SVG element with a specific ID in the `src/gtk2-assets.svg` file. To get that ID, we simply take their corresponding line in the `scripts/gtk2-assets.txt` file and replace the `/` with a `_`.

For example, if in `scripts/gtk2-assets.txt` there's a line like this:
```
Buttons/button
```

Then the script will render `assets/gtk2/Buttons/button.png` with the SVG element bearing the id `Buttons_button`.

To render an element at a different scale, simply add another line in the `scripts/gtk2-assets.txt` file and append a "@" followed by any whole number. For example, there's a line in `scripts/gtk2-assets.txt` that looks like this:
```
TitleBar/close@2
```
Then the script will render `assets/gtk2/TitleBar/close@2.png` with the SVG element with the id `TitleBar_close` at 2x the original scale.

## `gtk-2.0/gtkrc`

Once the SVGs are rendered, the script then generate a new `gtk-2.0/gtkrc` file according to the current KDE color scheme. 

The script uses `scripts/gtkrctemplate` as a template to fill in most of your current color scheme's colors..

It then override `gtk-2.0/gtkrc` with the newly created `gtk-2.0/gtkrc` file.

To put it simply, we just update most of GTK2's colors to the current's color scheme. 

Should you need to edit your `gtk-2.0/gtkrc` file it's wiser to edit `scripts/gtkrctemplate` instead and rerun the `scripts/kyzenred-generate.sh` script.

### `gtkrctemplate`

This file is actually quite similar to a standard `gtkrc` file with the exception of templated values.

These are easily recognizable as they are wrap in moustaches ( "{{" and "}}" ).

As long as you don't touch these everything should be fine. 

If you want to know more about this I recommend you to look at the scripts files. They are quite easy to read as long as you're familiar with bash.

## GTK3
The GTK3 stylesheet is based on KDE's breeze GTK theme. KDE will gracefully override any named GTK3 colors to match your current color scheme so everything should work out of the box. 

If you aren't running KDE then the standard Kyzenred color scheme will be used instead.
